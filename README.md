# ProjectHalo
This is the official repository of the Thanics Halo open-source project. This project is not complete yet and all documaentation has not been uploaded, but feel free to follow along with our progress or use any of our 3D parts or software, as long as you attribute us.
## The Drone
The Thanics Halo drone utilizes stereo camera vision and ultrasonic sensors to accomplish spherical obstacle avoidance. The Halo drone is built to be versatile with a variety of cameras of different imaging types. The project focuses primarily on 360 (spherical) imaging and spherical video live streaming.
## The Controller
The controller for the Halo drone is equally as innovative as the drone. This is a hybrid controller, able to be used either with two thumbs (traditional), or wrist-mounted for voice or touchscreen control.
## Files
